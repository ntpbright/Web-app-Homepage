                        <h5><b>A web service</b> is a service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the World Wide Web. In a web service, the Web technology such as HTTP—originally designed for human-to-machine communication—is utilized for machine-to-machine communication, more specifically for transferring machine-readable file formats such as XML and JSON. In practice, a web service typically provides an object-oriented web-based interface to a database server, utilized for example by another web server, or by a mobile app, that provides a user interface to the end user. Another common application offered to the end user may be a mashup, where a web server consumes several web services at different machines, and compiles the content into one user interface.</h5>
